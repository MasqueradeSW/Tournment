### 2.1 International format

A match may consist of:

- three games with each opposing players choosing the server for one of the three
  games, decided by the sum of the scores of both games, (a.k.a. "Home/Away/Neutral"), the 3rd game will be a server where both players have pings that are equal or closer to each other. Home players reserve the right to choose which side they want to be play on, left or right. Neutral will be decided on a coin flip.
  OR
- three games on a neutral server chosen by mutual agreement during match
  scheduling. Each player can only choose their sides in the first two games and switch accordingly. The 3rd game will be decided on a coin flip.

In the event that opposing players cannot agree on a neutral server according to
these rules, the Home/Away/Neutral system will be used.

See [Section 4: Servers](#section-4-servers) and
[Section 5: Match schedule](#section-5-match-schedule) for more guidance on
server selection and the scheduling process.

### 2.2 Swiss section

The first section will be a Swiss System tournament of 4 rounds. A match win
will score 1 point; a tie scores a half point; a loss or forfeit scores 0
points.

After the registration deadline, the registered participants will be seeded
according to the judgment of the Tournament Directors. The first round will
then be paired by a "top half vs bottom half" method. For example, if there are
10 participants, then the #1 seed will be paired against the #6 seed, the #2
seed against the #7 seed, and so on.

In subsequent rounds, participants will be paired at random against others with
the same record of Won : Lost games.

There will be no eliminations from the Swiss section due to poor results or
lost games.

#### 2.2.1 Double Jeopardy

Ideally, two competitors should not face each other more than once
during the Swiss section, but if circumstances call for it then it may be chnged.

#### 2.2.2 No-shows

Forfeits distort the results by unbalancing the tournament  . Moreover, they
disappoint other competitors who have joined the tournament to participate in
the competition.

Tournament Directors by posting in `game-discussion` or, if you prefer, by DMing
Masquerade. (Yes, really.)

If you forfeits any match, you **must** post in `#results` and clearly
state your ingame name along with your request to be paired in the next round. If
you do not, ***you may be removed from the tournament.***

#### 2.2.3 Deadlines

Because Swiss pairings are based on prior round scoring, the next round cannot
be paired until all the results of the previous round have been reported.

Therefore, unplayed matches will be recorded as a double forfeit. Under no
circumstances whatsoever will extensions be granted.

playoffs section will be a double-elimination knockout tournament.
